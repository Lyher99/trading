# Document: Development of Autonomous MT5 Gold Trading Bot with Python

---

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements, technologies, architecture, functionalities, and workflow for creating an autonomous trading bot that trades gold (XAU/USD) on MetaTrader 5 (MT5) using Python. The bot runs independently, executing buy, sell, and close orders based on its internal AI or rule-based strategy, without needing external signals.

---

## 2. Objectives

* Develop a Python-based bot to trade gold (XAU/USD) on MT5.
* Enable fully autonomous decision-making for opening and closing positions.
* Provide real-time trading execution.
* Optionally send trade notifications to a Telegram group.
* Ensure robustness, error handling, and efficient performance.

* Enable algorithmic trading in MT5 terminal settings.

---

## 5. Architecture and Components

### 5.1 Bot Core Module

* Connects to MT5 via the MetaTrader5 Python API.
* Fetches live and historical market data for XAU/USD.
* Executes the trading strategy logic to generate buy, sell, or close signals.
* Sends trade orders to MT5 based on signals.
* Handles order confirmation and error management.

### 5.2 Strategy Module

* Implements trading logic, which may be rule-based (e.g., moving average crossover) or AI/ML-driven.
* Analyzes price data and technical indicators.
* Generates actionable signals.

### 5.3 Notification Module (Optional)

* Uses Telegram Bot API to send real-time trade alerts to a Telegram group.
* Sends status updates and error notifications.

### 5.4 Scheduler Module (Optional)

* Manages periodic execution of data fetching and strategy evaluation.
* Ensures timely and consistent bot operation.

## 6. Functional Requirements

| Function                       | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Connect to MT5                 | Establish and maintain connection to MT5 terminal.                    |
| Fetch Market Data              | Retrieve historical and live data for XAU/USD at specified intervals. |
| Analyze Market Data            | Apply indicators or AI models to determine trading signals.           |
| Execute Trades                 | Send buy, sell, or close orders to MT5 based on signals.              |
| Manage Positions               | Track open positions and close them according to exit logic.          |
| Handle Errors                  | Detect and recover from connection issues and failed orders.          |
| Send Notifications (Optional)  | Notify Telegram group about trades and system status.                 |
| Schedule Operations (Optional) | Run the bot's main loop at regular intervals (e.g., every minute).    |

---

## 7. Workflow

1. **Initialization**

   * Start the Python script.
   * Initialize connection with MT5.

2. **Data Acquisition**

   * Fetch recent price and volume data for XAU/USD.
   * Update internal data cache.

3. **Strategy Evaluation**

   * Calculate indicators or feed data to AI model.
   * Generate trade signals (buy/sell/close).

4. **Trade Execution**

   * Check current open positions.
   * Place new orders or close existing ones accordingly.
   * Verify execution status.

5. **Notification**

   * Send trade details and alerts to Telegram group (if enabled).

6. **Wait and Repeat**

   * Pause for a defined interval (e.g., 60 seconds).
   * Repeat data acquisition and trading process.
